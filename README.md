3. The accumulated score tells the final winner.

### 1.2.2. Team making
1. If you enter the number of teams you want and the total number of people, you will randomly assign and output teams.

3. Anounces the number of seconds the user counted.
4. The closer the set second, the higher the score is given.
5. Each team will be given a score by calculating the number of times the problem is correct per level.

#### 4. GUESS THE RIGHT WORD

2. Users guess the original word and write down the correct answer, type it, and let them know the correct answer.
3. The more you get, the faster you solve, the higher the score.

### 1.2.4. Select Random Number

2. It may be used for various purposes, such as raffle of prizes, winning points, etc.

### 1.2.5. Enter Score Only

# Why is this project useful?
## 1.1. Software availability and expected effectiveness
1. It can reduce the hassle of preparing and proceeding team recreation games for ice break at the first meeting such as team mt or club mt.
2. The team allocation function allows you to organize teams by gathering close people and solve problems that took a long time for the host to count the number of people and make teams. It is also possible to create teams fairly because team members are created completely randomly.
3. By entering and calculating scores for each team, the host can eliminate the hassle of writing and adding scores for each team at the end of the game. It can also eliminate the possibility of mistakes in the calculation process.
4. The game can be played smoothly and quickly through the use of the game in the program. The game is more fair because various games in the program are also problems created by computers rather than by hosts.
5. It can solve problems and difficulties that hosts face in creating games. This is because if you add one by one to the game in the program, you can create more diverse and more diverse and new problems.
6. There's a timed function in the game, so speak with your body. In games where timing is important, such as games, it is quite convenient for computers to automatically and accurately tell the game time.
7. Since scores are automatically calculated by game, the host can save time when calculating the number of points he or she has adjusted for each team. And scores can be given fairly across the board.
8. If you don't need a game, you only need to use SCORE INPUT, which is equivalent to 999, so you can add and subtract points freely even if you don't necessarily use the games in the program in various situations, so you can perfect the score strength, which is the core of recreation.
